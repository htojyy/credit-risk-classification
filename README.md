# credit-risk-classification

## Purpose

The aim of this model is to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. This model aims to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers, and is built on a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

## Overview

The synthetic dataset contains 77,536 non-null observations. The aim was to predict the creditworthiness of a borrower by using `loan_status` column as the target to predict. The features that were input into the model include: `loan_size, interest_rate, borrower_income, debt_to_income, num_of_accounts, derogatory_marks, total_debt`

The method used to predict creditworthiness is `LogisticRegression`. The stages undertaken of the machine learning process were:

1. Read the csv as a Pandas DataFrame
2. Create labels/target and features
3. Use `train_test_split` to split the data into training and testing datasets
4. Fit the logistic regression model with training data
5. Evaluate the model's performance by a) generating a confusion matrix to show how many predictions are correct and incorrect per class, b) creating the classification report to print the accuracy, precision and recall statistics.

## Results

Training report

* Accuracy: 0.99
* Precision: [Healthy loan]: 1.00 [High-risk loan]: 0.85
* Recall: [Healthy loan]: 0.99 [High-risk loan]: 0.89

Testing report

* Accuracy: 0.99
* Precision: [Healthy loan]: 1.00 [High-risk loan]: 0.87
* Recall: [Healthy loan]: 1.00 [High-risk loan]: 0.89

## Summary

Looking at the two classification reports for the training and test data, the overall accuracy of the model's performance was the same for both the training and test data. However, the model is much more accurate at predicting a healthy loan (0) where precision is 1.00 (for both training and test datasets) compared to 0.85 and 0.87 for high-risk loans (1) for training and test datasets respectively.

Overall, this model is recommended to predict a healthy or high-risk loan; it has a high level of accuracy to predict correctly whether a loan would be considered healthy or high-risk, high level of precision to predict the target c. While healthy loan predictions may be subject to overfitting, further optimisation and fine-tuning may correct this, such as including more data, splitting the data differently, or auto-optimising the model.
